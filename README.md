# hosting-site-landing-page

This is one of the HTML and CSS assignments, was given in **Full Stack JavaScript Bootcamp 2.0** mentored by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) and [Anurag Tiwari](https://github.com/anuragtiwarime).

I have used CSS properties like **Flexbox**, **Grid**, **Position** to build the website and used **Media Queries** to make the website responsive. Also used `transition` property to create some animations.
